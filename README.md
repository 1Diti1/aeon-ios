# Aeon – Personal Growth iOS App

Aeon is an iOS app idea focused on simple, daily self-improvement with a clean, distraction-free interface.

## Current Stage

I'm in the **design + learning phase**:
- Working through an iOS app development course (Swift + Xcode)
- Taking notes on what I want the first version of Aeon to do
- Planning the main screens, navigation, and data structures

I’ll start committing code here once I’m comfortable with the basics of Swift and iOS development.

## Core Concept (v1)

- Guided daily prompts and reflections
- Simple progress view instead of gamified streaks/points
- Clean, minimal UI using modern iOS patterns

## Planned Tech Stack

- Swift
- Xcode
- GitHub (version control + project tracking)
